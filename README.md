### üõ†Ô∏è Project Standardization
<strong>Branching Strategy</strong>

This project follows a Gitflow-inspired branching strategy:

-   **`main`**: This branch represents the production-ready code. All development code is merged into `main` after thorough testing and review in PR.
-   **`develop`**: This is the primary development branch where all feature branches are merged. It represents the latest delivered development changes for the next release.

Branch Naming Conventions:
*   **`feature/*`**: For new features (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`).
*   **`bugfix/*`**: For fixing bugs in released versions (e.g., `bugfix/login-issue`). These are typically branched from `main` and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.
*   **`hotfix/*`**: For critical production bugs that need immediate fixing (e.g., `hotfix/critical-payment-bug`). These are branched from `main` and merged back into both `main` and `develop`.
*   **`docs/*`**: For changes related to documentation (e.g., `docs/update-readme`).
*   **`chore/*`**: For routine tasks, maintenance, or updates to the build process, tooling, etc., that don't directly affect the application's functionality (e.g., `chore/update-dependencies`).
*   **`refactor/*`**: For code refactoring that doesn't change external behavior (e.g., `refactor/optimize-database-queries`).

<strong>Commit Conventions</strong>

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This leads to more readable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description></description></type>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Type**:
Must be one of the following:
*   **`feat`**: A new feature
*   **`fix`**: A bug fix
*   **`docs`**: Documentation only changes
*   **`style`**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
*   **`refactor`**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
*   **`perf`**: A code change that improves performance
*   **`test`**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
*   **`build`**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
*   **`ci`**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
*   **`chore`**: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files
*   **`revert`**: Reverts a previous commit

**Scope** (optional):
The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For example `feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays`.

**Description**:
Contains a succinct description of the change:
*   use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
*   don't capitalize the first letter
*   no dot (.) at the end

**Body** (optional):
Just as in the **description**, use the imperative, present tense. The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

**Footer** (optional):
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Change**:
A commit that has a footer beginning with `BREAKING CHANGE:` introduces a breaking API change. A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.

Example:
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: extends key in config file is now used for extending other config files
